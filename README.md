# AI-water-level-indicator-controller-and-smarthome-project-with multiple Sensors
This is a smart Home dashboard panel with touch UI using Dwin Hmi 7 inch display 
The HMI will display Water level / Temperature /  Humidity / pressure / Altitude / Air Quality Index / Co2 monitoring / Dew point / Current Ac voltage / 12v 150Ah tubular lead acid battery and inverter parameters like (voltage , shunt voltage ,shunt resistance ,power consuption , charge in and charge out in mah/Ah ) realtime SoC etc) and can control led lights both using gpio pins and rf switches using Rf 433mhz transmitter 
and can run automations and will announce the water level and other announcments for automation on speaker using Dfplayer mini
this has dual display (Hmi 7 inch and 4x20 lcd) 
this has spftware based dryrun protection 
125watt UV disinfection is also added to disinfect water while pump is running
